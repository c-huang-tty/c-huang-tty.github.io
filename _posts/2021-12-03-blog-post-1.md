The World Model is used to visualize which real world objects the user's gaze intersects with. The World Model is constructed out of simple object such as planes, spheres, boxes, etc that describe the real world.

 The World Models are defined in a text file with the ending __.sew__. Any text editing software can be used to create and edit the world files but they need to be saved in the __.sew__ format.

 > All distances in the World Model (and elsewhere in Smart Eye Pro) are expressed in meters.

The objects will be positioned and oriented relative to the coordinate system of its parent. The root parent in the World Model is always the __WCS__, which is defined inside Smart Eye Pro. Object specific coordinate systems can be defined using __LocalCS__.

A World Model can be built using any of the following objects:

### LocalCS

The __LocalCS__ is a right-handed local coordinate system used to move and rotate a group of objects. A __LocalCS__ can be placed directly in the __WCS__ or inside another LocalCS. It is defined by an origin and x- and y-axes in its parent coordinate system.

```
LocalCS : {
    name = "localCS"
    origin = 0.1, 0.1, 0
    xAxis = 1, 0, 0
    yAxis = 0, 0.8, 0.2
}
```

### Plane

__Plane__ is a bounded 2D-surface in a 3D-space. The __Plane__ needs an anchor point that acts as the origin for the plane. The anchor points can be defined by any combination of y- and x-position of the words described in the tables below (case sensitive). The y-position word must be first followed by the x-position, for example _middleLeft_ or _lowerRight_.

| Y Position  | X Position  |
| :----       | :----       |
| lower       | Left        |
| middle      | Middle      |
| upper       | Right       |

The orientation of the plane is defined by the xAxis and the yAxis. This is an optional setting since the xAxis is (1,0,0) and yAxis is (0,1,0) per default, giving the plane the same orientation as the parent coordinate system.

A Plane can act as a container for other objects such as rectangular, circular zones and calibration points. If the gaze falls within a zone when intersecting the Plane the intersection object name in the data output will be extended by "__.zone name__".

Below is a __Plane__ with anchor point __lowerMiddle__.

```
Plane : {
    name = "MyPlane"
    lowerMiddle = 0.0, -0.05, -0.3
    xAxis = 1, 0, 0     // optional, if undefined it will be 1, 0 ,0
    yAxis = 0, 0.5, 0.2 // optional, if undefined it will be 0, 1, 0
    size = 1, 0.5

    RectangularZone : {
        name = "rectangular zone"
        lowerLeft = 0.1, 0.15
        width = 0.25
        height = 0.1
    }

    CircularZone : {
        name = "circular zone"
        center = 0.75, 0.25
        radius = 0.1
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c1"
        center = 0.25, 0.15
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c2"
        center = 0.75, 0.15
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c3"
        center = 0.25, 0.35
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c4"
        center = 0.75, 0.35
    }
}
```

### Screen
The Screen object is very similar to the Plane, but the coordinates for objects within the Screen are defined in _pixels_ instead of meters. An additional parameter _resolution_ is needed which represents the real resolution of the screen.

```
Screen : {
    name = "MyScreen"
    lowerMiddle = 0.0, -0.015, 0.02
    xAxis = 1, 0, 0 // optional
    yAxis = 0, .25, 0.04 // optional
    size = 0.34, 0.271
    resolution = 1280, 1024
    calibrationPoints = 4

    RectangularZone : {
        name = "rectangular zone"
        lowerLeft = 20, 20
        width = 250
        height = 200
    }

    CircularZone : {
        name = "circular zone"
        center = 600, 400
        radius = 100
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c1"
        center = 145, 120
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c2"
        center = 500, 200
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c3"
        center = 600, 500
    }

    CalibrationPoint2D : {
        name = "c4"
        center = 700, 750
    }
}
```

### Calibration Points
A CalibrationPoint that is placed within a Screen or Plane object is a CalibrationPoint2D. When placed free in the WCS or inside a localCS it is a CalibrationPoint3D. __A CalibrationPoint is only used for the gaze calibration phase and can never be intersected by the gaze vector__.

```
CalibrationPoint2D : {
    name = "c1"
    center = 145, 120
}

CalibrationPoint3D : {
    name = "CP_1"
    center = 0,0,0.4
}   
```

### Sphere
```
Sphere : {
    name = "a sphere"
    center = 0,0.15,0.3
    radius = 0.1
}
```

### Box
```
Box : {
    name = "MyBox"
    0,0,0
    .1,0,0
    .1,.1,0
    0,.1,0
    0,0,.1
    .1,0,.1
    .1,.1,.1
    0,.1,.1
}
```

### Cylinder
```
Cylinder : {
    name = "MyCylinder"
    bottomCenter = 0,0,0
    centerAxis = 0,1,0
    zeroAngleAxis = 1,0,0
    radius = 2.0
    height = 1.5
    startAngle = 45
    endAngle = 135
}
```

The y-axis of the object coordinate system is parallel to the centerAxis and is equal to 0.0 at the _bottom_ of the cylinder and 1.0 at the _top_ of the cylinder.

The x-value of the object coordinates is 0.0 at the _startAngle_ and increases to 1.0 at the _endAngle_.

> The __Laser Chessboard Tool (LCT)__ is an optional module that is of great help when building a complex World Model. It provides the exact location of a point in space relative to the WCS origin just by pointing with the laser on that position.
