Assume <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_1,X_2,...,X_n"> are samples from a population, __point estimation__ refers to constructing certain statistical quantities <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{\theta} = \theta(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)"> that can be used to estimate the distribution of the population. The method is not unique, the most commonly used methods are the method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood.
