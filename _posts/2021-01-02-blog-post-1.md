In 1985, Shakespearean scholar Gary Taylor discovered a nine-stanza poem in a bound folio volume that was attributed to Shakespeare (called the _Taylor poem_). The size
of the newly discovered poem is small relative to the size of Shakespeare's total work, only 429 total words. Can we prove that the poem was actually written by Shakespeare or not? 

Here is the analysis given in "Did Shakespeare write a newly-discovered poem?"

---
## Observation 
Of the 429 worlds in the newly discovered poem, 258 are distinct. Therefore, the analysis begins by ranking each of the 258 distinct words in the Taylor poem according to its rarity of usage in the Shakespearean canon. The results are shown in the following table, where the number (denoted as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_x">) denotes the number of distinct words in the Taylor poem which occurred exactly <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> times in the 884647 total words of the Shakespearean canon. For example, 9 distinct words in the poem appeared zero times in the canon, 7 distinct words in the poem appeared 1 times in the canon, etc.

## Estimation
Now that we have the real value of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_x">. The next step is to estimate the expected value of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_x"> assuming Shakespearean authorship, denoted as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{\nu}_x">. Assuming Poisson process, the results of an empirical Bayes estimate are shown in the following table.

| ----:| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0+   | 6.97    | 4.21    | 3.33    | 2.84    | 2.53    | 2.43    | 2.16    | 2.01    | 1.87    | 1.76  |
| 10+  | 1.62    | 1.50    | 1.52    | 1.51    | 1.36    | 1.38    | 1.33    | 1.28    | 1.25    | 1.22  |

| 30+  | 0.96    | 0.94    | 0.93    | 0.91    | 0.90    | 0.88    | 0.86    | 0.85    | 0.83    | 0.82  |
| 40+  | 0.80    | 0.79    | 0.77    | 0.76    | 0.75    | 0.74    | 0.73    | 0.72    | 0.70    | 0.69  |
| 50+  | 0.68    | 0.67    | 0.66    | 0.65    | 0.64    | 0.63    | 0.62    | 0.61    | 0.60    | 0.59  |
| 60+  | 0.58    | 0.57    | 0.56    | 0.55    | 0.54    | 0.53    | 0.52    | 0.51    | 0.50    | 0.50  |
| 70+  | 0.49    | 0.48    | 0.48    | 0.47    | 0.47    | 0.46    | 0.45    | 0.45    | 0.44    | 0.44  |
| 80+  | 0.43    | 0.42    | 0.42    | 0.41    | 0.41    | 0.40    | 0.39    | 0.39    | 0.38    | 0.38  |
| 90+  | 0.37    | 0.36    | 0.36    | 0.35    | 0.35    | 0.34    | 0.34    | 0.33    | 0.32    | 0.32  |

To broaden the empirical base of the results, seven more Elizabethan poems are analyzed using the same method, with three poems attributed to Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe and John Donne respectively, and the other four poems attributed to Shakespear. The results are omitted here.

## Modeling
The oabjective is to test whether the observed counts <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_x"> fit the predicted value <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{\nu}_x"> based on the assumption of Shakespearean authorship. The tests rely upon the following regression model:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\log\mu_x = \log\hat{\nu}_x %2B \beta_0 %2B \beta_1\log(x %2B 1)">

where for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x = 0, 1, ..., 99">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_x"> have independent Poisson distribution with means <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu_x">.

The null hypothesis:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_0: \beta_0 = \beta_1 = 0">

corresponds to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu_x = \hat{\nu}_x">.

The model can also be written in the form:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu_x/\hat{\nu}_x = e^{\beta_0}(x %2B 1)^{\beta_1}">

where we can see that if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_1 < 0">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\mu_x}/{\hat{\nu}_x}"> increases as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x \to 0">; if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_1 > 0">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\mu_x}/{\hat{\nu}_x}"> decreases as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x \to 0">. Therefore, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_1"> (__slope__) is of particular interest. 

## Tests
Three different tests are performed: Test 1, total account; Test 2, new words; Test 3, slope.

### Test 1
Let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_%2B"> be the total account of categories <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0-99">, then <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_%2B = 118"> for Taylor poem.

__Conclusion__

Test 1 is the least reliable for discriminating between Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean authorship.

Test 2 seems only moderately useful for discerning Shakespearean authorship.

Test 3, the slope test, is promising as a discriminator between Shakespearean versus non-Shakespearean authorship.

On the basis of the results, the Taylor poem appears consistent with the hypothesis of Shakespearean authorship. In particular it passes the slope test, which is the best
discriminator among the three. It fails the total count test, but less dramatically than do two of the four Shakespearean poems. Overall it seems fair to say that the Taylor poem fits Shakespearean usage about as well as do the four Shakespeare poems.
