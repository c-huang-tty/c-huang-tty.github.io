In 1985, Shakespearean scholar Gary Taylor discovered a nine-stanza poem in a bound folio volume that was attributed to Shakespeare (called the _Taylor poem_). The size
of the newly discovered poem is small relative to the size of Shakespeare's total work, only 429 total words. Can we prove that the poem was actually written by Shakespeare or not? 

Here is the analysis given in "Did Shakespeare write a newly-discovered poem?"


__Conclusion__

Test 1 is the least reliable for discriminating between Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean authorship.

Test 2 seems only moderately useful for discerning Shakespearean authorship.

Test 3, the slope test, is promising as a discriminator between Shakespearean versus non-Shakespearean authorship.

On basis of the results, the Taylor poem appears consistent with the hypothesis of Shakespearean authorship. In particular it passes the slope test, which is the best
discriminator among the three. It fails the total count test, but less dramatically than do two of the four Shakespearean poems. Overall it seems fair to say that the Taylor poem fits Shakespearean usage about as well as do the four Shakespeare poems.
