This post will summarize some of the commonly used continuous distributions.

## Uniform Distribution
A uniform distribution, sometimes also known as a rectangular distribution, is a distribution that has constant probability. The probability density function and cumulative distribution function for a continuous uniform distribution on the interval <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[a, b]"> are

## Exponential Distribution
Poisson distribution describes the the number of events occurring over a period of time, where the non-overlapping intervals are independent. Exponential distribution describes the distribution of waiting times between successive changes.

Given a Possion distribution with parameter <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu">, the distribution of waiting time would be

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D(x) = P(X\leq x) = 1 - P(X>x) = 1 - \dfrac{\nu^0e^{-\nu x}}{0!} = 1 - e^{-\nu x} (x > 0)">

and the probability distribution function would be 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(x) = D\text{'}(x) = \nu e^{-\nu x} (x > 0) ">

Like geometric distribution, exponential distribution is __memoryless__.

## Weibull Distribution
Expotential distribution can be seen as a special form of Weibull distribution, whose cumulative distribution function has the following form:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D(x) =  1 - e^{-\left({x}\text{/}{\beta}\right)^\alpha} (x > 0)">

and the probability distribution function would be 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(x) = \alpha\beta^{{-}\alpha}x^{\alpha{-}1}e^{-\left({x}\text{/}{\beta}\right)^\alpha} (x > 0) ">

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta"> is called __scale parameter__, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha"> is called __shape parameter__. Depending on its value, Weibull distribution can approximate various, even very different shapes. It is suitable for the characterization of time to failure as well as strength or load.

## Normal Distribution
Normal distribution is the most commonly used distribution in our life. It has the following probability density function.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2\text{/}(2\sigma^2)} ">

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma^2"> are mean and variance of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X"> respectively.

The so-called standard normal distribution is given by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu = 0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma^2 = 1"> in the general normal distribution. An arbitrary normal distribution can be converted to a standard normal distribution by changing variables to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z = (X-\mu)\text{/}\sigma">, yielding

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-z^2\text{/}2}dz">

Based on the standard normal distribution, the cumulative distribution can then be found utilizing the lookup table.

## Chi-Squared Distribution
If <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_i"> have __normal independent__ distributions with mean 0 and variance 1, then

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y = {\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2 \sim \chi_n^2\text{/}\chi^2(n)}">

is a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi^2"> distribution with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> degrees of freedom.

More generally, if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi_i^2"> are independently distributed according to a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi^2"> distribution with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n_1, n_2, ..., n_k"> degrees of freedom, then

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{k}\chi_i^2}">

is distributed according to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi^2"> with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n = \sum_{i=1}^kn_i"> degrees of freedom.

## Student's t-Distribution
Let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x_1, x_2, ..., x_n">  be independently and identically drawn from the distribution <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N(\mu, \sigma^2)">. Let 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\bar{X} = \dfrac{1}{n}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^nX_i}">

be the sample mean and 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S^2 = \dfrac{1}{n-1}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2}">

be the sample variance. The the random variable 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t = \dfrac{\bar{X} - \mu}{S\text{/}\sqrt{n}}">

has a Student's t-distribution with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n-1"> degrees of freedom.  

![](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-svg/StudentsTDistribution_900.svg)

The only difference of Student's t-distribution with standard normal distribution is that the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma"> in standard normal distribution is replaced with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S">. As <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> increases, Student's t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.

## F-Distribution
F-distribution arises to test whether two observed samples has the same variance. Let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi_m^2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi_n^2"> be independent <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi^2"> distribution with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> degrees of freedom respectively. 

The ratio of the two distributions

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_{m\text{,}n} = \dfrac{\chi_m^2\text{/}m}{\chi_n^2\text{/}n}">

has an F-distribution with degrees of freedom <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">.
