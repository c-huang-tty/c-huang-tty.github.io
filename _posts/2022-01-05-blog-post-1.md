There are various ways for communicating between local devices. Depending on our target devices, we can either connect two devices directly using cables and transfer data using protocals like CAN, Serial, TCP, UDP etc., or we can transfer data in wireless ways using protocals like Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiFi etc. 

In our application, the aim is to transfer data between PC and Jetson as well as PC and Arduino. As the distance is not very far, we have chosen __UDP__ as the main communication method. For arduino, we have also used __serial__ communication, which is very convenient when there is no ethernet shield.
