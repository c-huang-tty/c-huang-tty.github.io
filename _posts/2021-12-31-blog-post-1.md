Probability and statistics are two closely related fields in mathematics which concern themselves with analyzing the relative frequency of events.. Still, there are fundamental differences in the way they see the world.

To better understand this, let's start from an example.

__Example__

Suppose A and B were palying a best three out of five game with 100 dollars capital each, and the winner would win all the 200 dollars. However, due to certain reasons, the game had to be canceled when A had a 2:1 lead. Here comes the question: What is the fairest way to allocate the 200 dollars? 

__Solution 1__: As there is no final result, A and B should each obtain their 100 dollars. 

__Solution 2__: As A has a 2:1 lead, A should obtain all the 200 dollars.

__Solution 3__: As A has a 2:1 lead, A should obtain two thirds of the 200 dollars.

__Solution 4__: Suppose the probability of A and B winning the game are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_1"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_2"> respectively. A should obtain <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_1">/(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_1"> + <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_2">) of the 200 dollars.
