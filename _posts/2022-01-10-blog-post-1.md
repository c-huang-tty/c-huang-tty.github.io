Some examples about passing and returning pointers and references to and from functions have been discussed in the post [Passing and Returning References and Pointers](https://c-huang-tty.github.io/posts/2022/01/08/blog-post-1/). Some practical aspects about argument passing mentioned in [C++ Primier (5th Edition)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-primer-fifth/9780133053043/) will be summarized in this post.

## Arguments Passing
Parameter initialization works the same way as variable initialization. If the parameter is a reference, then the parameter is bound to its argument. Otherwise, the argumentâ€™s value is copied. Some examples about passing and returning pointers and references to and from functions have been discussed in the post [Passing and Returning References and Pointers](https://c-huang-tty.github.io/posts/2022/01/08/blog-post-1/). Some practical aspects about argument passing mentioned in [C++ Primier (5th Edition)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-primer-fifth/9780133053043/) will be summarized in this post.


### Passing Arguments by References
__Use reference to avoid copies__

1. When it's insufficient to copy objects that are large (e.g., long `string`)
2. When objects have a type that cannot be copied (e.g., `array`)

Below is an exanple comparing the length of two strings, as the string maybe long, it's better to avoid copying them.
```cpp
// compare the length of two strings
bool isShorter(const string &s1, const string &s2){
    return s1.size() < s2.size();
}
```    
    
__Use reference to return multiple variables__

There are several ways to return several values from a function, using reference is a very efficient way to do that. Below is an exanple returning the sum and difference of two integers.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void SumDiff(const int &a, const int &b, int& sum, int& diff){
    sum = a + b;
    diff = abs(a - b);
}
int main(){
    int sum, diff;
    SumDiff(3,4,sum,diff);
    cout << "sum is: " << sum << " " << "diff is: " << diff << endl;
}
```
Here is another example returning the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, and the reference parameter `occurs` counts how often `c` occurs (C++ Primier, P211).
```cpp
string::size_type find_char(const string &s, char c, string::size_type &occurs){
    auto ret = s.size();    // position of the first occurrence, if any
    occurs = 0;             // set the occurrence count parameter
    for (decltype(ret) i = 0; i != s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == c) {
            if (ret == s.size())
                ret = i;    // remember the first occurrence of c
            ++occurs;       // increment the occurrence count
        }
    }
    return ret;             // count is returned implicitly in occurs
}
int main(){
    string::size_type occurs;
    cout << "'a' first occurs in position " << find_char("Chao Huang",'a', occurs) << endl;
    cout << "'a' ocurs " << occurs << " times" << endl;
}
```
__Use reference to const when possible__

In the above examples, `a` and `b` are defined as `const int`, `s` is defined as `const string`, what if they are defined as `int` and `string` respectively? Let's try it.

For the first example, run the following codes. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void SumDiff(int& a, int& b, int& sum, int& diff){
    sum = a + b;
    diff = abs(a - b);
}
int main(){
    int sum, diff;
    SumDiff(3,4,sum,diff);
    cout << "sum is: " << sum << " " << "diff is: " << diff << endl;
}
```
The result is `error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type 'int&' to an rvalue of type 'int'`. As `3` and `4` are `rvalues`, we cannot assign it to `lvalues` like `a` and `b`. We should call the function like below, which will print the same results.
```cpp
int a = 3, b = 4, sum, diff;
SumDiff(a,b,sum,diff);
cout << "sum is: " << sum << " " << "diff is: " << diff << endl;
```
The same issue exists with the second example.

### Passing Arguments by Arrays
Two special properties affect how we define and use functions that operate on arrays:
1. Array cannot be copied;
2. Array is usually converted to a pointer when used.

Because of the second point, functions usually don't know the size of the array. There are several techniques to cope with it.

__Using a marker__

This method requires the array itself to contain an end marker. C-string is a good example of this.
```cpp
void print(const char* p){
    if(p)
        while(p)
            cout << *p++ << " ";
        cout << endl;
}
```

__Using standard library conventions__

This method is to pass pointers to the first and last element in the array. We can realize this using `begin` and `end` functions. 
```cpp
void print(const int* beginP, const int* endP){
    while(beginP != endP){
        cout << *beginP++ << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

__Explicitly passing size of the array__
```cpp
void print(const int intArr[], size_t size){
    for(size_t i = 0; i < size; i++){
        cout << intArr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

__Array Reference Parameters__

We can also define a parameter that is a reference to an array, as the size of an array is part of its type, we can print out the elements using __range `for`__ statement. However, the fact that the size is part of the type limits the usefulness of this version of 'print'. (This may not be the case using `templates`)
```cpp
void print(int (&intArr)[10]){
    for(auto elem: intArr)
        cout << elem << " ";
    cout << endl;
}
```
For multidimentional array, the same method applies.
```cpp
void print(int (&intArr)[10][10]){
    for (auto &row : intArr){  
        for (auto &col : row)  
            cout << col << " ";        
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```
Except this, the multidimensional array can also be passed in the following two ways.
```cpp
void print(int (*intArr)[10], int rowSize){

}
```
```cpp
void print(int intArr[][10], int rowSize){

}
```

## Return Statement

### Return a Reference or Pointer to a Local Object is Not Allowed
The return value is used to initialize a temporary at the call site, and that temporary is the result of the function call. When a function completes, its storage is freed, this means that references to local objects refer to memory that is no longer valid. The reference or pointer would point to a nonexistent object. 

One good way to ensure that the return is safe is to ask: __To what preexisting object is the reference referring?__

### Return Class Types
If a function returns a pointer, reference or object of class type, we can use the result of a call to call a member of the resulting object. This means that we can return multiple values from a function by defining a `class` or `structure` by including those values we want to return.

In the example below, function `Add` take two struct type variables as arguments and return a struct type object to store the total number of the books with the same ISBN. In the `main` function, we can use `Add(book1, book2).number` to get the member of the returned object directly.   
```cpp
struct Book {
    string ISBN;
    int    number;
};

Book Add(Book book1, Book book2) {
    Book totalBook;
    if (book1.ISBN == book2.ISBN) {
        totalBook.ISBN = book1.ISBN; // or book2.ISBN
        totalBook.number = book1.number + book2.number;
        return totalBook;
    }
    else {
        throw invalid_argument("The books have different ISBN numbers!");
    }
}
int main() {
    Book book1,book2;
    book1.ISBN = "book";
    book1.number = 3;
    book2.ISBN = "book";
    book2.number = 4;
    cout << Add(book1, book2).number << endl;
}
```

### Reference Returns Are Lvalues
Whether a function call is an lvalue depends on the return type of the function. As the example given in the post [Rvalue and Rvalue References](https://c-huang-tty.github.io/posts/2022/01/09/blog-post-1/), calls to functions that return references are lvalues. And a call to a function that returns a reference can be used in the same ways as any other lvalue.

In the following example, `function(localVariable)` can be used as an `lvalue` and `*ptr` before and after the function call would be `0` and `1` respectively.
```cpp
int globalVariable = 1;
int& function(int& localVariable){
    return localVariable;
}
int main(){
    int localVariable = 0;
    int* ptr = &localVariable;
    cout << *ptr << endl;
    function(localVariable) = globalVariable;
    cout << *ptr << endl;
}
```

### Return a Pointer to an Array
Because we cannot copy an array, a function cannot return an array. However, a function can return a pointer or a reference to an array. 

The form of a function that returns a pointer to an array is:
>Type (*function(parameter_list))[dimension]

Notice that for a one dimensional array, the form would simply be:
>Type *function(parameter_list)

Below is an example showing the difference between returning a pointer to one and two dimensional arrays, `*ptr1` and `*ptr2` would be `1` and `5` respectively. 
```cpp
int arr1[5] = { 1,2,3,4,5 };
int arr2[2][3] = { 5,4,3,2,1,0 };
int* function1() {
    return arr1;
}
int(*function2())[3]{
    return arr2;
}
int main() {
    int* ptr1;
    int (*ptr2)[3];
    ptr1 = function1();
    ptr2 = function2();
    cout << *ptr1 << endl;
    cout << **ptr2 << endl;
}
```

The most straight way is to use a type alias, for the example above, the codes below would also work. `*ptr3` and `*ptr4` would be `2` and `1` respectively. 
```cpp
int arr2[2][3] = { 5,4,3,2,1,0 };
typedef int arr3[3];
using arr4 = int[3];
arr3* function3(){
    return arr2;
}
arr4* function4(){
    return arr2;
}
int main() {
    int (*ptr3)[3], (*ptr4)[3];
    ptr3 = function2();
    ptr4 = function2();
    cout << *(*(ptr3 + 1)) << endl;
    cout << *(*(ptr3 + 1) + 1) << endl;
}
```

The same function can also be realized using so-called __trailing return type__, for the example above, this will also work. `*ptr5` would be `0`.
```cpp
auto function5() -> int(*)[3]{
    return arr2;
}
int main() {
    int (*ptr5)[3];
    ptr5 = function2();
    cout << *(*(ptr5 + 1) + 2) << endl;
}
```
