`matplotlib` is a fairly low-level tool. `pandas` itself has built-in methods that simplify creating visualizations from DataFrame and Series objects. And `seaborn` further simplify the procedures. Unfortuantely, `seaborn` doesn't have built-in support for 3D functionalities. However, we can still use `seaborn` style for 3D `matplotlib` plots.
