## Data Collection Considerations
- Data types
  - Time frame
  - String
  - Numeric
  - Bool
  - Ordinal
  - ... 
- Data sources
  - First-party data: Collected by oneself.
  - Second-party data: Collected directly by another group and then sold. 
  - Third-party data: Sold by a provider that didn't collect the data themselves, which might come from a number of different sources.  
- Data collection method
  - Interviews
  - Observations: Used a lot by scientists
  - Forms
  - Questionnaires
  - Survey
  - Cookies: Web data collection
  - ...
- Data volume
  - Population
  - Sample

## Data Modeling Levels and Techniques
### [Data Modeling Levels](https://www.1keydata.com/datawarehousing/data-modeling-levels.html)
- **Conceptual data modeling**
  - Includes the important entities and the relationships among them.
  - No attribute is specified.
  - No primary key is specified.
- **Logical data modeling**
  - Includes all entities and relationships among them.
  - All attributes for each entity are specified.
  - The primary key for each entity is specified.
  - Foreign keys (keys identifying the relationship between different entities) are specified.
  - Normalization occurs at this level.
- **Physical data modeling**
  - Specification all tables and columns.
    - Entity names are now table names.
    - Attributes are now column names.
    - Data type for each column is specified. 
  - Foreign keys are used to identify relationships between tables.
  - Denormalization may occur based on user requirements.
  - Physical considerations may cause the physical data model to be quite different from the logical data model.

### [Data Modeling Techniques](https://dataedo.com/blog/basic-data-modeling-techniques)
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**
  - **Entities** representing objects (or tables in relational database),
  - **Attributes** of entities including data type,
  - **Relationships** between entities/objects (or foreign keys in a database). 
- **UML Class Diagrams**
  - **Class**: Equivalent to entities in an ERD
  - **Attributes**: Equivalent to attributes in an ERD
  - **Methods**
  - **Relationships**
    - Between objects: Equivalent to relationships in an ERD
    - Between classes  
- **Data Dictionary**
  - List of data sets/tables
  - List of attributes/columns of each table with data type
  - Item descriptions,
  - Relationships between tables/columns,
  - Additional constraints

## Data Transformation
Data transformation involves:
- Adding, copying, or replicating data 
- Deleting fields or records 
- Standardizing the names of variables
- Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
- Joining one set of data with another
- Saving a file in a different format
- Long -> Wide, Wide -> Long
  - Long data is data where each row contains a single data point for a particular item.
  - Wide data is data where each row contains multiple data points for the particular items identified in the columns. Wide data is data where each row contains multiple data points for the particular items identified in the columns.  

**Wide Table**

|   | A  | B | C |
|---|---|---|---|
| I  |  a |  b | c  |
| II  | d  |  e | f  |
| III  |  g |  h |  i |

**Long Table**

|   | F1  | F2  | F3|
|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | I  |  A | a|
|  2 | I  |  B |b|
|  3 | I  |  C |c|
| 4  | II  | A  |d|
| 5  | II  | B  |e|
| 6  | II  | C  |f|
| 7  | III  | A  |g|
| 8  | III  |  B |h|
| 9  | III  |  C |i|
