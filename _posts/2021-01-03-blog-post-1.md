This post will summarize some of the commonly used discrete distributions.

## Bernoulli Distribution
The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution having two possible outcomes labelled by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=1"> in which <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=1"> occurs with probability <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n=0"> occurs with probability <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=q = 1 - p">. Therefore, it has __probability density function__

which can also be written as

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(n) = p^n(1-p)^{1-n}">

The __cumulative distribution function__ is

The performance of a fixed number of trials with fixed probability of success on each trial is known as a __Bernoulli trial__.

The distribution of heads and tails in coin tossing is an example of a Bernoulli distribution with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p=q=1/2">. The probability of A winning each game in the example give in [this](https://c-huang-tty.github.io/posts/2021/01/01/probability-and-statistics/) post is an example of Bernoulli distribution with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p=p, q=1-p">.

The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest discrete distribution, and it the building block for other more complicated discrete distributions.

## Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution gives the discrete probability distribution <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P_p(n|N)"> of obtaining exactly <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> successes out of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N"> Bernoulli trials. The __binomial distribution__ is therefore given by

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b(n, p) = \dbinom{N}{n} p^nq^{N-n} = \dfrac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}p^nq^{N-n}">

Given the binomial distribution, the probability of obtaining __more successes than__ the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> observed in a binomial distribution is

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(X>n) =\sum_{k=n%2B1}^Np^k(1-p)^{N-k} = I_p(n%2B1, N-n) ">

where

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_p(a, b) = \dfrac{B(p%3Ba,b)}{B(a,b)}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B(a,b)"> is the __beta function__, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B(p%3Ba,b)"> is the __incomplete beta function__, with 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B(a,b) = \dfrac{(a %2B b - 1)!}{(a-1)!(b-1)!}">

and

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B(p%3Ba,b) = {\displaystyle \int_0^px^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}dx}">

To prove the above relationship, first differentiate both sides wrt <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p">.

Then integrate, we get
