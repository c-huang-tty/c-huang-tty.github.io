Functions that have the __same name__ but __different parameter lists__ and that appear in the __same scope__ are overloaded. When we call these functions, the compiler can deduce which function we want based on the argument type we pass. Here arise a question: when does two parameter lists differ? 

## Defining Overloaded Functions
Here is an example given in C++ primier. Although it looks like the parameter types are different in the following two pairs, each pair actually defines the same function.
```cpp
Record lookup(const Account& acct);
Record lookup(const Account&);    // parameter names are ignored

typedef Phone Telno;
Record lookup(const Phone&);
Record lookup(const Telno&);      // Telno and Phone are the same type
```

In can be more trickier with `const` parameters. Parameters defiend as __references/pointers to const__ and __const pointers__ can behave very differently. When parameters are defined as __const pointers__, as the `const` declaration only declares the pointers to be const, the arguments passed to the function can still only be nonconstant, which is the same as __plain pointers__. In this way, the conpiler cannot distinguish which function to call according to the parameter lists. Therefore, the second declaration in the following example would be a mistake.   
```cpp
Record lookup(Phone*);
Record lookup(Phone* const);  // redeclares Record lookup(Phone*)
```

When parameters are defined as __references to const__ or __pointers to const__, as the objects they referece/point to are constants, the compiler can use the constness of the argument to distinguish which function to call. Therefore, the following two pairs of functions would be different declarations.
```cpp
Record lookup(Account&);        // function that takes a reference to Account
Record lookup(const Account&);  // new function that takes a reference to const

Record lookup(Account*);        // new function, takes a pointer to Account
Record lookup(const Account*);  // new function, takes a pointer to const
```

> Note: Because there is __no conversion from const__, we can pass a const object (or a pointer to const) only to the version with a const parameter. Because __there is a conversion to const__, we can call either function on a nonconst object or a pointer to nonconst.
```cpp
int i = 0;
const int j = 1;
int* const ptr1 = &i;       // ok
int* const ptr2 = &j;       // error: invalid conversion from 'const int*' to 'int*'
const int* ptr3 = &i;       // ok
const int* ptr4 = &j;       // ok
const int* const ptr5 = &i; // ok
const int* const ptr6 = &j; // ok
```
