The Smart Eye Pro system is a head and gaze tracking system, which measures the subject's head pose and gaze direction in 3D.

## Head Tracking

Head tracking estimates the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the subject's head in the world coordinate system.

It uses a personal profile that is created automatically in the "Automatic Profile" mode.

A profile is a model of the subject's head that contains the 3D coordinates and tracking templates of salient facial features such as eye corners, nostrils, mouth corners, and ears. By detecting the positions of some of the features in the profile while tracking, the system can calculate the pose of the head.

### Head Position Quality
The head position quality (the __HeadPositionQ__ value) indicates the current tracking state:
- __Face Finder__: Face Tracking is not initialized yet or was lost over a longer period of time. Quality is 0.1.
- __Face Refinder__: Face Tracking was temporarily lost and the face tracker is trying to recover. Quality is 0.2.
__Face Tracking__: Face Tracking works normally. Quality is 1.0.

### Automatic Profile
After starting tracking, the profile is initialized automatically when the face is visible in at least one camera. During tracking the profile is updated and improved continuously, i.e. more tracking templates are added to cover a wider range of head rotations and the 3D head geometry is recalculated to better fit the subject's head.

The generated profile can be saved and will not be updated anymore thereafter. Turn off tracking and save the profile under _Profile->Save as...._

When a gaze calibration is performed, it can be saved to the profile, by turning off tracking and selecting _Profile->Save_.

Good tracking results are generally achieved using a profile which includes __20 seconds__ of tracking followed by a __gaze calibration__. It is thereafter recommended to save the profile.

When tracking is turned off, the previous profile will be active when tracking is started again.

## Gaze Tracking
Gaze tracking calculates the 3D gaze measurements in the world coordinate system.

### Gaze Measurement
A "Gaze Measurement" is defined by a "__Gaze Origin__" point in 3D space plus a "__Gaze Direction__" vector.

There is a separate gaze measurement for the left and the right eye. These are combined into a "Consensus" gaze measurement for a virtual eye positioned at the midpoint between the left and the right eye.

### Gaze Direction Quality
The __GazeDirectionQ__ value can take any floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 and depends on a number of factors. Thus, it is __not__ easy to set a general threshold, where all gaze data below that threshold should be considered unreliable, for all possible setups and subjects.

### Gaze Caliberation
The gaze direction measurement is affected by several parameters such as the individual __eye geometry__, __refracting eyeglasses__, and __individual characteristics__ such as strabismus. This means the gaze direction needs to be adjusted uniquely for each individual. __The purpose of the gaze calibration is to determine the difference between the visual and the optical axis of the eye and other relevant eye parameters__.

#### Gaze Calibration Points
Before a calibration can be started, a number of calibration points need to be added to the World Model. These points should be easy to distinguish and evenly spread over the area of interest. If they are not on a screen or a plane their 3D position needs to be defined in the world coordinate system. 

#### Gaze Calibration
Gaze calibration is performed through the Gaze Calibration dialog. The <span style="color:red">__red dots__</span> on the circles for the "Left Eye" and "Right Eye" shows where the current uncalibrated gaze intersects a plane, orthogonal to the current calibration point in theWorld Model with the vector direction towards
the eye center. <span style="color:blue">__blue dots__</span> show all saved samples and <span style="color:green">__green dots__</span> show the samples after the calibration has been processed. Ideally the <span style="color:green">__green dots__</span> should be in the middle of the target. __Each circle__ on the target corresponds to __2 degrees of accuracy__.

The accuracy and standard deviation of the calibration can be checked for each point. If any point has a value that significantly differs from the others it should be removed and "trained" again.
