Expectation, Variance and Covariance (Correlation).

---
## Expectation
For discrete variable <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X">, the __expectation__ is 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E(x) = {\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^\infty x_ip(X=x_i)}">
 
For continuous variable <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X">, the __expectation__ is 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E(x) = {\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty xp(x)dx}">
  
---
## Variance
For variable <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X">, the __variance__ is 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=var(X) = E\left((X - E(X))^2\right) = E(X^2) - E^2(X)">
 
The square root of it is called __standard deviation__, expressed as

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma(X) = \sqrt{var(X)}">

or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_X">.

## Covariance
Covariance provides a measure of the strength of the correlation between two or more sets of random variates. 

The __covariance__ for two random variates <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y">, each with sample size <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N">, is defined by

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=cov(X, Y) = E\left((X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))\right) = E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)">

For unrelated variables,

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=cov(X, Y) = E(XY)-E(X)E(Y) = E(X)E(Y) - E(X)E(Y) = 0">

For <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X=Y">,

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=cov(X, Y) = E(X^2)-E^2(X) = \sigma_X^2">

which reduces to the usual variance. Therefore, the covariance can also be denoted as

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_{XY} = cov(X, Y)">

__Carrelation__ is the standardized version of covariance, which is defined as

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=cor(X, Y) = \dfrac{cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y} = \dfrac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{XX}\sigma_{YY}}}">
