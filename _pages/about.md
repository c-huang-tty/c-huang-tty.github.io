I received the B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tongji University in 2017 and the M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2020. Since then, I have been working towards the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo, where I am working on driver monitoring and prediction, human-machine-interface, and automated driving.

Having been working on the Ph.D. program for some time, I think it is time to have my own academic website to keep my research in progress. Therefore, I forked this Github page template from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). Hopefully, I can post some reading notes and the problems I encountered as well as the possible solutions to keep record of my research progress. You can find these posts [here](https://c-huang-tty.github.io/year-archive/). 

Hope you enjoy what youâ€™re reading here!
