I received the B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tongji University in 2017 and the M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2020. Since then, I have been working towards the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo, where I am working on driver monitoring and prediction, human-machine-interface, and automated driving.
