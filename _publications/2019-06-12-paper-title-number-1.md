## Abstract
X-by-wire (XBW) technologies lay the foundation for electric and autonomous vehicles, and one of the most important aspects is the brake-by-wire (BBW) systems, among which, the electro-hydraulic brake (EHB) has already been applied to commercial vehicles successfully. To satisfy the demands for fast response and high reliability of the BBW system, a novel electric booster (E-Booster) combined with EHB is designed in this paper actuated by a BLDC motor. By careful analysis, a detailed model of the EHB system with E-Booster is established. As precise pressure control is crucial for the performance of EHB system, a dual-loop adaptive control algorithm is proposed which could attenuate external disturbances even with unknown system parameters. Finally, simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Moreover, this control scheme has the potential to be integrated into advanced applications, such as active vehicle dynamics control of intelligent and autonomous vehicles.
