## Abstract
Due to increasing complexity of systems in industrial applications, decoupling control of interconnected or cascaded systems has been discussed a lot recent years. A traditional way to deal with the system is to decouple the system states so that the states of each subsystem can be dealt with independently. This works theoretically well in most cases, however, for systems with high dimensions or with constraints on specific subsystems, this method may not be efficient or flexible enough in practical applications. In view of this, this paper proposes a backpropagation algorithm for decoupling control of a linear time invariant cascaded system with inner feedback loops, which simplifies the complicated system into several simpler ones, so that the system can be dealt with more efficiently and flexibly. Accordingly, the stability of the system is analyzed in a feedforward way, establishing the sufficient as well as necessary conditions for asymptotic stability of the system. Simulation experiment on the steering module of a steer-by-wire system verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, future researches following this paper are pointed out to perfect the algorithm proposed.
